    # Chemical Property Prediction:
    #     Train regression models to predict specific chemical properties of the generated molecules, such as solubility, toxicity, or binding affinity. Rank the molecules based on their predicted values for these properties.

    # Diversity Scoring:
    #     Calculate diversity metrics to ensure a broad distribution of chemical structures. Common metrics include Tanimoto similarity, molecular fingerprints, or other structural diversity measures. Rank molecules based on how different they are from each other.

    # Drug-likeness Filters:
    #     Apply drug-likeness rules or filters like Lipinski's Rule of Five to filter out molecules that violate common medicinal chemistry guidelines. Rank the remaining molecules based on their compliance with these rules.

    # Machine Learning Models:
    #     Train a classification model to predict whether a generated molecule is "interesting" or "promising" based on a set of predefined criteria. Rank the molecules based on the model's predictions.

    # Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):
    #     Utilize a GAN for molecular design and then train a discriminator to distinguish between real and generated molecules. Rank molecules based on their discriminator scores, with higher scores indicating more "realistic" molecules.

    # Molecular Docking:
    #     Use molecular docking simulations to estimate the binding affinity of generated molecules with a specific target protein. Rank the molecules based on their docking scores, which indicate their potential as drug candidates.

    # QSAR Modeling:
    #     Create Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models to predict the biological activity of generated molecules. Rank the molecules based on their predicted activity scores.

    # Expert Rules and Filters:
    #     Apply domain-specific rules and filters based on expert knowledge to evaluate the generated molecules. Rank the molecules based on their compliance with these rules.

    # Self-Organizing Maps (SOM):
    #     Use SOM to cluster the generated molecules into different regions of the map based on their structural similarity. You can then rank the molecules within each cluster.

    # Reinforcement Learning:
    #     Set up a reinforcement learning framework where the molecules are generated sequentially, and a reward function is defined to evaluate the quality of the generated molecules. Rank molecules based on their cumulative rewards.

    # Human Expert Evaluation:
    #     If possible, involve domain experts to manually evaluate the generated molecules. Rank the molecules based on their expert-assigned scores for properties like drug-likeness, novelty, and synthetic feasibility.

    # Hybrid Approaches:
    #     Combine multiple of the above methods to create a hybrid ranking system, taking into account different aspects of molecular quality.
